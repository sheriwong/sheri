            which provides an interesting and fun way to motivate people of all backgrounds to participate
            in environmental activism. It functions by bringing awareness to sustainable living through

        <p class="proj-text">Our team identified the audience and proceeded to create three personas.
          One of the personas is Brian Romano. We focused the guiding principles such as <strong>simple,
          intuitive and digestible navigation, easy access and desired functions, and clear communications</strong>
          to users in order to convey the importance of environmentalism and balance fun while being informative.</p>

          <p class="proj-text">Here is the user journey map for our beginner user. We have mapped out his general interactions
             with the app along with his satisfaction level and included his thoughts behind his intentions as well. </p>

          <div class="user-journey-text">
          <p class="proj-text">By looking at his journey, we can see the highs and lows of his experience.
            His main goal with the app is to learn about feasible methods he can implement to reduce waste
            and to be more eco-friendly in general and so, he would have the most satisfaction with our modules feature.
            This feature would provide him with the information and tips he needs in order to start taking initiatives
            in improving the environment.</p>

          <p class="proj-text">However, there is also a downside to this feature which would frustrate our user.
            In the modules/checkpoints page, our user would not be able to move past the modules without reading
            and completing the current one. He would have to complete a quiz and that could be very frustrating for him.
            This could potentially turn users off from reading the modules as they donâ€™t have the option to read ahead
            or choose the modules they want to actually read.</p>

        <h3 class="proj-header">Iterations of Features</h3>
        <p class="proj-text">Originally, our application included a Tamagotchi-like character that the user has
          to maintain through playing educational games daily. Our team wanted the interface to be clean,
          so I designed the first iteration of the Challenges page. After discussions, we decided to make the contrast greater.
          Gillian and I reworked the screens.</p>

            <h3 class="proj-header">User Texting + Findings</h3>
            <p class="proj-text">After the screens were completed, we conducted user testing.
              The user test included pre-test questions to gauge habits related to the use of lifestyle or game mobile applications.
              The tasks allowed the user to walk through normal interaction flows within our application.
              The post-test questions allow us to determine how well the user understood the application,
              important features, and their level of interest in our application.
            </p>

            <p class="proj-text">Through A/B testing, it was shown that </p>
            <ul>
              <li>100% of participants preferred upon-use onboarding for the home screen and game introduction</li>
              <li>100% of participants expressed confusion in how the pages were interconnected, for instance how the homepage and community page fits in with the user goals</li>
              <li>100% of participants noted a habit of skipping through text and preferred graphics over text-based communication</li>
              <li>75% of the participants sought out tangible feedback for motivation</li>
              <li>62% of the participants preferred real-life games and games that were more impactful</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="proj-text">As a result, we will shift a bigger focus to goal-oriented tasks. We will offer and highlight a variety
              of tiers for goals that challenges type 1 users to work towards.

            I incorporated more colour and user feedback so that they can see how much time they have left.
            Further, when they pause the timer, the water is greyed out because the water is not flowing anymore.

        a sense of accomplishment. I also included tangible results of how much water the user saved from taking a
        shorter shower in forms of 4L milk jugs for equivalent comparisons and easier comprehension.

        <p class="proj-text">The self-reporting tasks give users tips and tricks on how to be eco-friendly
          but rely on the integrity of the users to report doing the activity. Above is a recycle water challenge.
          Once the user has completed one way to repurpose water, the user has to hold onto the button until a circle
          forms to complete the challenge which gives the user the agency for interaction.

          Through user testing, weekly iterations and communications, we were able to identify the essential core
          features of our application which includes the userâ€™s progress, challenge type and length, tasks, achievements
          and social aspect through challenging friends.
