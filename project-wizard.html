        <blockquote class="introduction">Wizardly Wonders is a front-end coding interactive,
          digital game about a girl who is on her way to learning how to become a wizard.
          My role in this project was to build a game based on game development fundamentals
          using an object-oriented and event-driven program, Processing. </blockquote>

        <div class="block-section">
          <h3 class="proj-header">Design Process + Decisions</h3>
          <p class="proj-text2">I started by ideating the theme of the game.
            Next, I planned out the story behind the game. When I was coding the different levels,
            I greyboxed the graphics because greyboxing helps determine if a game mechanics alone,
            makes the game fun. In addition, I did not want this game to be a graphics dependant game.
            I wanted to add more game mechanics such as powerups. </p>

          <div class="image-container">
            <div class="greybox-image-box">
            <figure>
            <img class="greybox-image" src="img/wizard/greybox.png" alt="greybox">
            <figcaption>First iteration of game in boxes</figcaption>
            </figure>
            </div>

            <div class="greybox-image-box">
            <figure>
            <img src="img/wizard/greybox2.png" alt="greybox">
            <figcaption>Second iteration, added platforms and colour scheme</figcaption>
            </figure>
            </div>
          </div>


          <p class="proj-text2">At the beginning of the game, I designed the game so that the player
            has to interact with objects and NPCs (non-player character) to learn about the game environment.
            There are three levels in the game. By collecting enough experience, a boss will appear.
            The player has to beat the boss in order to advance to the next level.</p>

          <div class="center-image">
          <figure>
          <img class="sprite" src="img/wizard/walk-cycle.png" alt="character's walk cycle">
          <figcaption>Walk cycle of the player</figcaption>
          </figure>
          </div>

          <p class="proj-text2">I made sprites on Adobe Photoshop and incorporated the images in the game to
            create a walk cycle and poses for the player’s character. I also made sprites for the enemies to
            give them movement. I created digital art for the project to keep the style consistent.
            Based on collision decision, I programmed triggers that allowed the player to advance to the next scene.
            I thought that it would be more intuitive for the player to click on the correct book to advance rather
            than pressing the next arrow button.</p>

          <div class="image-container">
            <div class="greybox-image-box">
            <figure>
            <img class="greybox-image" src="img/wizard/library-before.png" alt="digital drawing of a library">
            <figcaption>Library scene without texture and lighting</figcaption>
            </figure>
            </div>

            <div class="greybox-image-box">
            <figure>
            <img class="greybox-image" src="img/wizard/library-after.png" alt="digital drawing of a library">
            <figcaption>Library scene with texture and lighting</figcaption>
            </figure>
            </div>
          </div>


          <p class="proj-text2">I added sounds effects to every interaction so there is feedback when
            the characters or objects are moving. While coding the different levels, I incorporated different difficulty components
            in level two and three which included moving platforms. The player jumps onto the moving platform
            and the platform continues to move back and forth or up and down. When the platform leaves,
            the player would be suspended in midair instead of falling and losing a life. I looked at the Stack
            Overflow forums to try to figure out how to fix the logic. I came up with three solutions and they
            all did not work. I presented the solutions to my professor and he said that I needed an extra line
            of code to make my player fall.</p>

          <div class="center-image">
          <figure>
          <img class="midair-image" src="img/wizard/midair.png" alt="bug in a game where the character floats in midair">
          <figcaption>A bug that makes the character suspended in midair</figcaption>
          </figure>
          </div>

          <p class="proj-text2">Had I not fix the bug, I would have eliminated the moving platform because the
            moving platform is an extra feature that I would add onto the backlog.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="greybox">
            <div class="section-greybox">
              <h3 class="proj-header">Interaction Map</h3>
              <div class="project-image">

                <img src="img/wizard/interaction-map.jpg" alt="interaction map of the game">
                <figcaption>Interaction map of the story component of the game</figcaption>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="block-section">
          <h3 class="proj-header">Takeaways</h3>
          <p class="proj-text2">Overall, I learned that I would go beyond the requirements to make
            my project look aesthetically pleasing. I meticulously calculated the coordinates in order for
            the animation to run smoothly and align with the image (i.e. the animation of the tower
            when the player wins). In the future, I would like to develop more complex interactive storylines
            and improve on my foundation in coding. Sometimes when I wanted to go back to the code,
            it was difficult to find because I did not add enough comments in the code. Moving forward,
            I should write more comments than code.</p>
