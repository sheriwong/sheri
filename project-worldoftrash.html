      <blockquote class="introduction">Our World of Trash is a hypothetical exhibit designed to be featured at
      Science World where attendees can recognize the importance of waste management through playfully
      interactive and visual elements.

          <h3 class="proj-header">Design Opportunity</h3>
          <p class="proj-text">Originally, our team worked with Green Chair Recycling, an event recycling management company.
            However, due to conflict in schedule, we were no longer able to work them. Using the insights and data gathered
            through ethnography research, on-site and remote one on one interviews, on-site observation as volunteers and
            shadowing staff, we made a pivot and narrowed down our domain to Science World.</p>


        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="block-section">
        <h3 class="proj-header">Why Science World?</h3>
        <p class="proj-text">For one, Science World has a well-defined indoor space which gives us more freedom
          to explore ideas without the constraints of weather and terrain of outdoor spaces.
          Secondly, Science World attendees and staff are primed, by the already <strong>existing exhibitions</strong>,
          to be more open to interactive mechanisms. Finally, Science World attendees are mostly <strong>families with children</strong>,
          which provides a good opportunity to redesign waste station interactions to a more specific demographic who are open to learning.</p>

          <div class="user-journey-text">
          <h3 class="proj-header">Ludic Approach</h3>
          <p class="proj-text">From our journey map and research findings, we can conclude that attendees at events have no interest in
            interacting or learning about sustainability from Green Chair Recycling volunteers and staff. Trash-throwing is not a memorable activity,
            and trash-throwing outdoors and indoors are different in their affordances as well. As a result, we decided to go for a ludic approach
            in hopes to evoke playfulness.</p>

      <div class="block-section">
        <h3 class="proj-header">Design Problem + Revised Goals</h3>
        <p class="proj-text">During further research while ideating, we found that the main problem people had with recycling was
          either because they <strong>didn’t know enough</strong> or that they <strong>didn’t care enough</strong>. Knowing and caring are essential for habit development
          and behavioural change. If there were more information on what to recycle, that could increase recycling awareness and
          subsequently influence recycling behaviour. </p>

        <p class="proj-text">I conducted some secondary research. According to Coca Cola Enterprise, children can be ‘agents of change’
          in improving household recycling. Further, people are less motivated to recycle because they don’t know what happens to the
          item after they’ve discarded it.</p>

        <p class="proj-text">Therefore, we decided to focus our exhibitions within these areas of opportunity. Which leads to our revised goals.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Simulate scenarios for attendees to experience the impact of improper waste management, and the possibilities for improvement</li>
        <li>While inviting playful interaction, aim to equip attendees, particularly parents, to learn and to teach their children on how certain waste should be sorted and disposed</li>
        <li>Leave attendees with easy steps they can take to help educate and manage waste in their lives</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="proj-text">As a whole, we want attendees to reflect on their own waste disposal processes and incite curiosity to learn more.</p>

        For the UI design, I wanted to try a recent trend, neumorphism. Although was a slight learning curve, I am glad that I tried
        something new and am happy with the end results. In this project, I learned the importance of components. It saves a lot of
        time when I have to adjust repeated elements. Finally, I put emphasis on user-centered design and let go of cool interactions
        such as the swiping of the cards so the user can focus on tasks. I also had to remind myself to keep the layouts simple so
        the end-user can perform tasks at a quick glance.
