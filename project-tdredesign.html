          <h3 class="proj-header">Design Opportunity</h3>
          <p class="proj-text">Quick <strong>user testing</strong> has allowed me to find out that young adults tend to use their mobile banking app
            at least once a week. These apps were used to check their balance, conduct E-Transfers, and/or pay bills.
            I was able to find an opportunity for <strong>UI and UX improvements</strong> for these commonly performed tasks.</p>

      <div class="block-section">
        <h3 class="proj-header">Design Problem</h3>
        <p class="proj-text">The screens in checking balances and sending money to others lack visual indications and are text-based.</p>

        <p class="proj-text"><strong>Pain point #1: </strong>Upon entering the TD app, the app prompts the user to choose a task. After choosing, the user is brought to the login
          page. After logging in, the app then brings the user to the task that they’ve chosen which disrupts the task flow.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="proj-text"><strong>Pain point #2: </strong>To send money in the current app, the user can either select a previously added recipient,
          import from their phone’s contact list or add a recipient. When selecting a recipient, there are no shortcuts
          to find a specific person. Subsequently, the user has to scroll down the list of recipients to find the newly
          added contact.

          <p class="proj-text">I started sketching layouts of different the accounts page,
            so the user can easily select the account they want to view. I also sketched how each individual account.
            For E-Transfer, I explored different ways where the user can access frequent recipients and approaches to
            add more visuals.

        <h3 class="proj-header">User Testing + Findings</h3>

        <p class="proj-text">Due to the time constraint of this project, I tested 8 users who use at least one banking app for at least twice a
          week to check their balance, conduct e-transfers and pay bills.  </p>

        <p class="proj-text">The findings were as follow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>75% of the users use external apps to manage their expenses and investments and did not find the buttons pertaining to investments useful</li>
          <li>50% of the users pay off their credit card bills once a week, thus they want to see the total for the pending transactions</li>
          <li>87.5% of the users find the swiping motion to go to other accounts distracting</li>
          <li>100% of the users were overwhelmed by the amount of information on the investment cards</li>
          <li>50% of the users said that the type of accounts on the account page is not obvious because of the weight of the font</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="proj-text">Implementation of findings:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hide the functions that are not often used in a kebab menu.</li>
          <li>Combine the dashboard and the accounts page</li>
          <li>Add colours to the cash amount going in and out of accounts</li>
          <li>Add a pending total in credit card account page</li>
          <li>Separate and remove some of the information on the investment account cards</li>
          <li>Thicken the font-weight to show the account type on the cards</li>

            with the swipe down motion.
            Unlike the current TD banking app, the user may switch accounts only if they press the back button.
            The user is able to see the pending amount on the credit card screen.</p>

              After filling out the information, a pop-up indicates that the contact is successfully added. The enter amount
              screen follows after the pop-up fades out. In the new flow, the newly added contact is automatically selected

      <p class="proj-text2">Overall, I learned that I would go beyond the requirements to make
        my project look aesthetically pleasing. I meticulously calculated the coordinates in order for
        the animation to run smoothly and align with the image (i.e. the animation of the tower
        when the player wins). In the future, I would like to develop more complex interactive storylines
        and improve on my foundation in coding. Sometimes when I wanted to go back to the code,
        it was difficult to find because I did not add enough comments in the code. Moving forward,
        I should write more comments than code.</p>
